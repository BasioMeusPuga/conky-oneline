# conky-unitary
Conky config that shows (and hides) statistics within the space of one line

## Requirements
* conky-lua

## Installation
* The conkyrc file is to be saved as `.conkyrc` wherever you want. Just point to it with `conky -c`.
* The python and lua scripts go into the `.conky` directory. This is not optional.
* ConkyScript.py has adjustable options in the first few lines. I seriously recommend going through them.

*Caveat emptor: I've set the update interval to 10s. I won't recommend going lower than 5*
